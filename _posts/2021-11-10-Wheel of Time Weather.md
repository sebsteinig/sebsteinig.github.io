After the successfull [Dune outreach work](/blog/2021/Dune/), we used the current media interest around the Amazon Prime TV adaptation of "The Wheel of Time" to engage new audiences to talk about climate science. 

There is some evidence that the WoT world is actually set on our own Earth, but approximately 18,000 years into the future. We therefore address the question: Would todayâ€™s climate change still be experienced in the World of the Wheel? We adjusted a climate model to the WoT world to find the answer.

As for our Dune work, I added a new interactive visualisation for one full year of the simualted WoT weather at [climatearchive.org/wot](https://climatearchive.org/wot.html#) with a short animation at the top. You can read our full, easy-to-understand article about our results at [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/wheel-of-time-is-set-thousands-of-years-from-now-yet-its-still-burdened-with-todays-climate-change-174088).
