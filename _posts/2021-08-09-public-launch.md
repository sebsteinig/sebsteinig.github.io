Yesterday, I introduced climatearchive.org with the tweet at the bottom.

I was very happy to see how quickly the launch got traction on Twitter, even though this was my very first tweet ever.
A lot of great feedback and ideas in the comments and more than enough support to continue the development. 
It definetely seems to resonate with people, both from science **AND** tech communities.
