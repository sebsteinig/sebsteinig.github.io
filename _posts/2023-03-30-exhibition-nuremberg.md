After the successfull collaboration with a natural history museum [last year](/blog/2022/exhibition-frankfurt/), I was invited to contribute an interactive visualisation to another new special exhibition ["Horizons: Histories and Futures of Migration"](https://www.gnm.de/your-museum-in-nuremberg/exhibitions/highlights/horizons/), which is opening today in the "Germanisches Nationalmuseum" in Nuremberg, Germany. The exhibition tells stories about human migration from the Stone Age to the Space Age, with a particular focus on examples from art and culture. As a climate physicist, this is slightly out of my comfort zone, which made the collaboration even more interesting to me.

I contributed to the question: "Home Planet: How Do We Want to Live Together in the Future?". For this, I adjusted my original [COP26 visualisation](/blog/2021/COP26/) to the specific museum needs. Visitors will be able to compare CMIP6 model projections for 1.5°C and 3°C global warming side-by-side to address the question "Which future do you want"? A screenshot of the final museum app is shown below.

There is also a 300-page exhibition book that accompanies the exhibition and describes its motifs ([available as PDF](https://books.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/arthistoricum/catalog/book/1185)). I certainly never expected to see climatearchive.org listed between proper artworks, Perry Rhodan and Solarpunk ;).
