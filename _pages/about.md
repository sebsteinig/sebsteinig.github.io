I am a climate scientist at the University of Bristol trying to understand how and why the climate system changes through time. I combine computer models with observations and paleoclimate reconstructions to understand and constrain the physical mechanisms of past and future climate change. 

I am particularly interested in making our complex climate data accessible to more people, e.g. scientists from other disciplines, policymakers or the wider public. I am developing hands-on, interactive visualisations to share the beauty of the underlying environmental data and to give people new tools to make informed, data-based decions for their own future. I am currently developing the [ClimateArchive](https://climatearchive.org) platform to let everyone explore hundereds of millions of years of climate change and to put it into context of the projected future climate change.

Have a look at some examples of my work and public outreach on this site and please get in touch via the platforms at the bottom if you want to discuss any of this further!
